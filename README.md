# Supervised learning

Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output
variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from
the input to the output.

Y = f(X)

The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have
new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that
data.

# Regression

Regression analysis consists of a set of machine learning methods that allow us to predict a continuous outcome variable (y) based on the value of one or multiple predictor variables (x).

Briefly, the goal of regression model is to build a mathematical equation that defines y as a function of the x variables.
